# Advancing Protein Function Annotation with Equivariant Graph Networks
Protein function research helps in understanding complex biological processes within cells. However, the intricate nature of protein structures and functions, along with the rapid growth of protein sequence data, presents a pressing challenge to develop efficient computational methods for protein annotation. In this study, we propose ENGINE, a multi-channel deep learning framework designed for robust protein function annotation. ENGINE integrates an equivariant graph convolutional network model to capture geometric features from protein 3D structurals, leverages ESM-C to encode evolutionary and sequence-derived information, and combines an innovative 3D sequence representation that unifies spatial and sequential signals. We demonstrate that ENGINE consistently surpasses current state-of-the-art methods across diverse protein function prediction benchmarks, demonstrating robust generalization and high predictive accuracy. Beyond performance, ENGINE provides interpretable insights into key sequence features and substructures, enabling the identification of functionally critical residues within proteins. This facilitates a deeper mechanistic understanding of protein function annotation outcomes and supports hypothesis generation for downstream biological studies. By offering reliable predictions with biological interpretability, ENGINE contributes to advancing research into cellular processes and disease mechanisms.

# Data
The original input dataset is in **FASTA format**, containing amino acid sequences of target proteins. To obtain corresponding 3D structures in **PDB format**, we use [**ESMFold**](https://github.com/facebookresearch/esm) for structure prediction.

## Feature extraction and tool description
### **Foldseek**
Extracting 3Di Tokens with Foldseek :
 [github.com/steineggerlab/foldseek.](https://github.com/steineggerlab/foldseek) Change to the corresponding Foldseek path in the **infer_main.py**  and  **GUI/engine.py**.
```python
foldseek_executable = 'foldseek/bin/foldseek' # Foldseek installation path
```
### **DSSP**
 Extraction of secondary structure features using [DSSP.](https://swift.cmbi.umcn.nl/gv/dssp/) Change to the corresponding DSSP path in the **infer_main.py**  and  **GUI/engine.py**.
```python
dssp_executable = '/usr/bin/dssp' # DSSP installation path
```
### **ESM-C**
We use the ESM-C 6B model provided by ESM
(https://github.com/evolutionaryscale/esm) for sequence embedding extraction, which is currently only supported by the Forge API. Go to https://forge.evolutionaryscale.ai/ and register an account to get the API Token.   
The **infer_main.py**   and  **GUI/engine.py** files in the project uses the **Features/esm-c** path to read features by default. Please change the path to the actual location according to the result you downloaded. Example:
```python
# Enter the token you applied.
token= '******' # API Token
```

```python
# Modify feature loading location
esm3_6B_path = 'Features/esm-c'  # Please change the path to the file you actually downloaded
```
Users can use the following script to extract ESM-c features on a large scale.
```python
python ESM3C_feature_extractor.py --input_file pdbs.txt

```
The content of **pdbs.txt** is as follows, each line is the path to the protein pdb file. The ESM-c features will be saved to **GUI/Features/esm-c**
```python
6ASO-C.pdb
4RH6-A.pdb
4FEZ-A.pdb
```
## Create Environment with Conda
First, create the environment. Download and install the anaconda platform. (Refer to https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/anaconda/install#linux-installer).
```python
conda create -n ENGINE python=3.8
```
Then, activate the "ENGINE" environment and enter into the workspace.
```python
conda activate ENGINE
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# Usage
The **infer_temp** folder allows you to batch store PDB files that need to be tested and enter MF, BP or CC categories at runtime. The model file corresponding to the corresponding path in **infer_main.py** is saved in [here](https://zenodo.org/records/15276485), just download it and save it to the model folder.
For example:
```python
python ENGINE_main.py --data_list ./infer_temp --cate cc
```
The sample output file is **infer_result.csv** with the following sample content:
```python
4RH6-A,cell outer membrane,GO:0009279,0.5082
4RH6-A,cell division site,GO:0032153,0.0011
